# Support Chat API — Staff & User Conversations

This document describes the backend endpoints for the support chat system.
There are two controllers: **User** (`/api/v1/support`) for regular users and **Staff** (`/api/v1/staff/support`) for admin/moderator staff.

All endpoints require a valid JWT bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
The caller's user ID is extracted server-side from the JWT `sub` claim — no client-supplied user ID is trusted.

All JSON responses use **snake_case** field names.

## User Endpoints

Base path: `/api/v1/support`
Auth: JWT bearer token (user role)

### 1. GET /api/v1/support/conversation

Get the current user's support conversation.

**Purpose:** Retrieves the user's single support conversation. A conversation is auto-provisioned on first access.

**Request:** No parameters.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "status": "IDLE",
  "user_last_read_sequence": 5,
  "next_public_sequence": 10,
  "last_public_message_at": "2026-07-13T12:00:00Z",
  "last_public_message_sender_type": "STAFF",
  "closed_at": null,
  "created_at": "2026-07-10T09:00:00Z"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Conversation not found (not yet provisioned)

---

### 2. GET /api/v1/support/conversation/messages

List messages in the user's support conversation with cursor-based pagination.

**Purpose:** Fetches a page of messages ordered newest-first. Use `before_sequence` for infinite scroll / load older messages.

**Query Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `before_sequence` | long | No | — | Only return messages with `sequence_number < before_sequence`. Omit to get the latest messages. |
| `limit` | int | No | `25` | Max messages per page (capped at 50, min 1) |

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "conversation_id": "uuid",
      "sequence_number": 10,
      "sender_type": "STAFF",

      "attachments": []
    }
  ],
  "next_before_sequence": 5
}
```

**Errors:**
- `404` — Conversation not found

---

**Path Parameters:**

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `conversationId` | UUID | ID of the conversation |
| `attachmentId` | UUID | ID of the attachment |

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "download_url": "https://storage.example.com/support-attachments/...?signature=..."
}
```

**Errors:**

## Attachment Constraints

These constraints apply to both user and staff message endpoints.

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Max attachments per message | 10 |
| Max file size (general) | 25 MiB (26,214,400 bytes) |
| Max file size (voice) | 25 MiB (26,214,400 bytes) |
| Max voice duration | 300,000 ms (5 minutes) |
| Allowed content types (general) | `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `application/pdf`, `text/plain` |
| Allowed audio content types | `audio/m4a`, `audio/mp4`, `audio/aac`, `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/webm`, `audio/x-m4a` |
| Allowed voice file extensions | `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.webm` |
| Attachment kinds | `IMAGE`, `DOCUMENT`, `TEXT`, `VOICE`, `OTHER` (auto-detected from content type) |
| Signed URL TTL | 300 seconds (5 minutes) |
| Storage bucket | `support-attachments` |

File names are sanitized: non-alphanumeric characters (except `.`, `_`, `-`) are replaced with `_`, and names are truncated to 200 characters.

### Voice Message Handling

When an audio file is uploaded, the backend:
1. Validates the content type is in the allowed audio list (see above)
2. Validates the file extension matches an allowed audio extension
3. Validates the file size does not exceed the voice max file size
4. Validates the duration (from `durations` parameter) does not exceed 300,000 ms
5. Normalizes the content type: `audio/x-m4a` and `audio/mp4` (with `.m4a` extension) are normalized to `audio/m4a`
6. Auto-detects `attachment_kind` as `VOICE` for all audio content types
7. Stores `duration_ms` in the attachment metadata

## Error Responses

All error responses follow the standard Spring `ResponseStatusException` format.

### Error format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-07-13T12:00:00.000+00:00",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Support conversation not found",
  "path": "/api/v1/support/conversation"
}
```

### Status codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `400` | Validation error (missing required field, invalid value, empty message, too many attachments, disallowed content type, file too large) |
| `403` | Caller lacks required role (ADMIN or MODERATOR for staff endpoints), or user trying to access another user's attachment |
| `404` | Conversation or attachment not found |
| `409` | Idempotency conflict — a message/note with the same `clientMessageId` / `clientNoteId` already exists |
| `422` | Business rule violation (conversation is closed, staff cannot send first message, conversation not in closeable/reopenable state) |
| `500` | Unexpected server error |

### Idempotency

Both message and note creation endpoints accept a client-generated UUID (`clientMessageId` / `clientNoteId`). If a request with the same ID is submitted again, the backend returns `409 Conflict` rather than creating a duplicate. The frontend should generate a UUID per send action and retry with the same UUID on network failures.
